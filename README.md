# Libraries Under Sea

## *Long live the C programming language!*


Here are some libraries written in C:

- ### Libft
*My fundamental C library which was built at 42 Silicon Valley.*
    
- ### Libef
*A C library which provides advanced data structrues, such as linked lists, hash tables, trees, and graphs.*

(I know this picture is not really related to the title, but I just want it on my github. ╮(￣▽￣)╭)
