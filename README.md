# Libraries Under Sea

## *Long live the C programming language!*

Here is the *Kraken Under Sea*. I just could not find a nice image for our title *Libraries Under Sea*. But you know what, this is actually a good image, too. C is my best-loved and most often used language; to me, using it is just as natural as breathing. However, I am always filled with awe when writing it. Writing C is like piloting a longship above a sea in which a KRAKEN is slumbering under. If you rampage through, you may wake the evil monster up. **Beware**!

Here are some libraries written in C:

- ### [Libft](https://github.com/AlphaPiece/libraries-under-sea/tree/master/ft)
*My fundamental C library which was built at 42 Silicon Valley.*
    
- ### [Libef](https://github.com/AlphaPiece/libraries-under-sea/tree/master/ef)
*A C library which provides advanced data structrues, such as linked lists, hash tables, heaps, trees, and graphs.*
